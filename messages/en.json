        "subtitle": "Common questions about electric fireplaces.",
        "viewAll": "View All Questions",
        "q1": "How does an electric fireplace work?",
        "a1": "Electric fireplaces are devices that convert electrical energy into heat, warming your room while providing visual flame effects. Inside, there is a heating mechanism that works to increase the room's temperature. LED lights on the front simulate flame effects, providing an aesthetic appearance.",
        "q2": "What are the advantages of an electric fireplace?",
        "a2": "Easy Installation: No chimney or gas connection required. Energy Efficiency: Converts energy directly into heat. Eco-Friendly: No carbon emissions. Heat Control: Thermostats allow you to adjust the temperature. Aesthetic Appeal: Fits any interior decoration with visual flame effects.",
        "q3": "Can I use an electric fireplace in any room?",
        "a3": "Yes, electric fireplaces can be used in any room with an electrical outlet. Since they don't require a chimney, they offer flexible placement options indoors.",
        "q4": "Is it safe to use an electric fireplace?",
        "a4": "Electric fireplaces are manufactured to high safety standards. Heaters often have automatic shut-off features to prevent overheating. Additionally, modern electric fireplaces are designed to be safe for children and pets.",
        "q5": "How do I maintain an electric fireplace?",
        "a5": "Electric fireplaces are low-maintenance devices. The LED lights and heaters are generally long-lasting. Periodic dusting and cleaning are sufficient. You can also refer to your product manual for more maintenance information.",
        "q6": "How much electricity does an electric fireplace consume?",
        "a6": "Energy consumption depends on the model and usage duration. On average, electric fireplaces consume between 1-2 kWh per hour. This provides comfortable heating with low energy costs.",
        "q7": "Is there a real flame in an electric fireplace?",
        "a7": "No, electric fireplaces do not use real flames. However, modern models use LED lights and special effects to simulate the look of real fire, creating a warm atmosphere visually. These effects provide an aesthetic look and create a pleasant ambiance.",
        "q8": "How do I install an electric fireplace?",
        "a8": "Installation is quite simple. Usually, only an electrical connection is required. You can easily install it at home by following the installation guide provided with the product. If you need professional help, you can get support from our authorized services.",
        "q9": "Can I use an electric fireplace in the summer?",
        "a9": "Yes, electric fireplaces can be used not only in winter but also in summer. You can turn on the flame effect without the heat to provide just a visual atmosphere. This adds a warm touch to your room even in summer."
